The goal of this project is to chart a clear path for getting the _required_ elements loaded on government websites.

- [The U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov)
- [The Digital Analytics Program](https://digital.gov/services/dap/)
- [Required Web Content and Links](https://digital.gov/resources/required-web-content-and-links/)
- [Gov Banner](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/header/)
- Gov Anchor _(NEW in progress)_
